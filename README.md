# Project: Message Mixer

Hello!

I'm Bianca, and this project is part of the Codecademy course **"Learn Intermediate JavaScript."**

I have created a program that offers a message-encryption service, transforming input text using various ciphers and displaying the encrypted message in the console.

There are three encryption methods provided by this program:

### Caesar Cipher
In this method, the characters of the input message are shifted alphabetically by a given amount.

### Symbol Cipher
This method replaces selected characters from the input message with visually similar symbols.

### Reverse Cipher
In this method, each word of the input message is reversed in place.

You can check the results in:
- [`message-mixer.js`](https://github.com/biancatrindade/message_mixer/blob/bianca/message-mixer.js)
- [`encryptors.js`](https://github.com/biancatrindade/message_mixer/blob/bianca/encryptors.js)
- [`super-encoder.js`](https://github.com/biancatrindade/message_mixer/blob/bianca/super-encoder.js)

**See you there!**
